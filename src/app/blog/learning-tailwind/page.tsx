          Sooo… I pushed to production without testing. 😅  
          Yeah. Literally broke everything. Buttons weren’t working, layout was off, and the API I thought I set up properly? Completely ignored it.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first instinct was to panic, but after 10 deep breaths (and one chai), I got to work. Rolled back the deploy, opened my VS Code, and hunted the bug like it stole my cookies.
        </p>

        <p>
          My brain said, &quot;Yaar, yeh kya hai? Why would I ever write{" "}
          <code>p-4</code> instead of just writing a CSS rule once and reusing it?&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I tried it. And… well, let’s just say I went from &quot;meh&quot; to &quot;marry
          me&quot; in one afternoon.
        </p>

        <h2>The Confusion Stage 🤯</h2>
        <p>
          My first Tailwind project looked like someone spilled alphabet soup all
          over my HTML. Classes like{" "}
          <code>bg-pink-200 p-4 rounded-xl shadow-md hover:scale-105</code> were
          screaming at me, and I thought: &quot;This can’t be real. This can’t be
          maintainable.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the funny thing is… it <em>was</em>. Instead of juggling five
          separate CSS files or hunting for which SASS partial controlled my
          button padding, everything was right there. Every style was immediate,
          visible, and tweakable without breaking a chain of styles somewhere
          else.
        </p>

        <h2>The “Ohhh I Get It” Stage 💡</h2>
        <p>
          The more I worked with Tailwind, the more I realized how freeing it is.
          I wasn’t switching between HTML and CSS anymore. I wasn’t worrying
          about naming conventions like BEM or fighting with old utility
          classes. I was just… building.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Need margin? <code>m-4</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Need responsive padding? <code>p-2 md:p-6</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Need to center everything? <code>flex items-center justify-center</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Suddenly, UI ideas moved from my brain to the browser way faster. I was
          iterating in real-time. I didn’t have to leave my HTML for 90% of my
          styling needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Can’t Live Without It Now 💖</h2>
        <p>
          Tailwind feels like it understands my dev brain. I can prototype
          lightning-fast. I can theme stuff with{" "}
          <code>tailwind.config.js</code>. And with JIT mode, I basically get
          infinite possibilities without shipping a huge CSS file.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quot;Once you start thinking in Tailwind, going back to writing traditional
          CSS feels… slow.&quot;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Do I still write custom CSS sometimes? Sure. But Tailwind is my
          default. It makes me <em>enjoy</em> styling again, and that’s something
          I didn’t think was possible after years of battling with stylesheets.
        </p>

        <p>
          So yeah, Tailwind CSS: Love at first class. 💅 I’m never looking back.
