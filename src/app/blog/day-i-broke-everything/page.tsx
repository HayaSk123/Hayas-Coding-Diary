          Soooâ€¦ I pushed to production without testing. ðŸ˜…  
          Yeah. Literally broke everything. Buttons werenâ€™t working, layout was off, and the API I thought I set up properly? Completely ignored it.

          My first instinct was to panic, but after 10 deep breaths (and one chai), I got to work. Rolled back the deploy, opened my VS Code, and hunted the bug like it stole my cookies.

          The issue? A missed `useEffect` dependency and a wrong env variable in the config. Classic me.

          Lesson learned: **never skip testing** â€” even if the feature &quot;looks small.&quot; ðŸ™ƒ
